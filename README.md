# kaldi-egs
This repo contains customized Kaldi recipes intended for training DNN feature extractors.
Each recipe has its own dataset. Some of the datasets are open-sourced, while others like the Dementia or Alzheimer's corpora are not.
They can be requested for use, tho. Just drop me a message.
This repo also contains a recipe for doing word and phone level forced-alignments using the Tedlium-v3 corpus.
